# Sales Dashboard Analysis

This project showcases a comprehensive sales dashboard created using Excel to visualize and analyze key performance metrics from a dataset. The goal of this project is to evaluate sales performance based on various metrics, providing valuable insights for decision-making.

## Project Overview
The dashboard provides a detailed analysis of sales data over a specified time period. It includes key metrics such as total revenue, units sold, NMV (Net Merchandise Value), sales trends by hour, and product performance. 

## Key Features

- *Average Order Value (AOV)*: Displays the average value of each customer transaction, helping to evaluate customer spending patterns.
- *NMV and Items Sold by Hour: Analyzes NMV and the number of items sold throughout the day, calculated using **HOUR* to track sales performance based on time.
- *Sales by Location: Analyzes sales performance by geographical location, utilizing **VLOOKUP* to reference location data from external tables.
- *Top-Selling Products: Identifies the best-performing products by the number of units sold, calculated using **INDEX MATCH* for efficient product matching.
- *Courier Usage Breakdown*: Visualizes the distribution of shipping methods used by customers, offering insights into logistics preferences.
